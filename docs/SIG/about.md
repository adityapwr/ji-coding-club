SIG(special intrest group) is a group of people who are interested in a particular topic. The SIG is open to all students of the Jio Institute, and is run by a team of student volunteers. The SIG organizes a variety of activities, including workshops, coding competitions, and hackathons. The SIG also hosts a number of guest speakers from the industry, who share their experiences and insights with the students. The SIGs are as follows:
